# ios-devsetup
## Intro
You've got a new MacBook or other Apple-flavored computer and you're just itching to get into iOS application development. This is a common occurrence, whether you've started a new job, decided to upgrade your existing kit, or you won the lottery and decided it's best to have a secondary career besides retirement.

This document is designed to help you, the reader, setup your new Mac so you can hit the ground running and build that killer app you've been noodling about forever. This is by no means a definitive list, but it's what has worked for me. 

## Applications
#### Xcode
It's a good idea to get Xcode, which is the free IDE from Apple, if you are going to mold some code into an app. Xcode has a reputation for being rather annoying, a resource hog, buggy, etc. but it is a necessity. You could give AppCode by JetBrains a try as well, but you have to purchase it.
